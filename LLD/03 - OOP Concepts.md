# OOP Concepts

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation means keeping data private and letting the object control how data is used.

### Abstraction

Abstraction means exposing only what's essential and hiding implementation details behind clear interfaces.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism means allowing objects, methods to take on multiple forms, enabling a single interface to represent different behaviors.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is mechanism where a new class derives attributes and behaviors from an existing class.


When inheritance works?

Inheritance makes sense when we have stable, shared implementation that multiple subclasses genuinely need.

When Inheriance breaks down?

Classic mistake is using inhertiance to model behavior differences. If subclasses need to override methods to provide completely different implementations, thats a sign.
